[b]Rhee Syngman[/b] was born in [b]1875[/b] into a kingdom already [color=gray][i]collapsing[/i][/color]. He grew up watching the [b]Kapsin Coup[/b] burn out in days, the [b]Gabo Reforms[/b] imposed by foreign bayonets, the [b]Independence Club[/b] crushed by a dynasty too feeble to save itself. He threw himself into the cause anyway — and for his trouble, he was [b]arrested[/b], [b]tortured[/b], and [b]caged[/b]. In prison he wrote [i]The Spirit of Independence[/i], equal parts [color=gold][i]sermon[/i][/color] and [color=red][i]curse[/i][/color]: a declaration that Korea could be free, and a vow that he would [color=red][b]never forgive[/b][/color] those who yielded.

That vow defined his life. Rhee watched the men he once admired — eloquent cultural nationalists like [b]Yi Kwang-su[/b], reformers who spoke of [i]destiny[/i] and [i]dignity[/i] — turn [color=gray][i]collaborator[/i][/color] the moment it was easier to bow than resist. He had warned it would happen, and he was right. With each betrayal he shed another layer of faith in [i]compromise[/i], convinced that only [color=red][b]vigilance[/b][/color], [color=red][b]strength[/b][/color], and an [color=red][b]unforgiving nationalism[/b][/color] could protect liberty. He still dreamed of [b]democracy[/b], Jeffersonian in his heart — but it was a [b]Jacksonian democracy[/b], one that demanded loyalty and punished weakness.

Exile in [b]America[/b] taught him the [i]language of freedom[/i] but stripped away the last illusions. He lobbied the [b]United States[/b] for decades, and learned the truth: the great powers did not see Korea as a [color=gold][b]nation[/b][/color], only as a [color=gray][i]pawn[/i][/color]. He would never again trust his country’s fate to the promises of others, or to the [i]naïve dreamers[/i] who believed those promises. And so, when he returned to a liberated Korea in [b]1945[/b], and when [b]Lyuh Woon-hyung’s provisional republic[/b] emerged in [b]1948[/b], Rhee took the presidency but found only [color=gray][i]ghosts[/i][/color]: idealists who reminded him of [b]1905[/b], [b]1910[/b], every surrender and every humiliation. Neutrality, balance, compromise — to him, all [color=red][i]preludes to betrayal[/i][/color].

To his admirers, he is the [b]prophet[/b] who sees every knife before it strikes. To his enemies, an [i]authoritarian in waiting[/i]. To himself, he is the [i]dreamer[/i] who was [color=red][b]right too many times[/b][/color], and who will [color=red][b]never again[/b][/color] let “[i]idiots[/i]” ruin his country’s destiny.
