[b]Kim Ku[/b] was born in [b]1876[/b] to a Korea already trembling before the storms of empire. His youth was not marked by compromise but by [color=red][i]vengeance[/i][/color]: as a young man he killed a Japanese man in righteous fury, and from that day onward lived as if his life belonged not to himself but to the nation. His path led through [b]prison[/b], [b]exile[/b], and the long years of struggle in Shanghai, where he became the beating heart of the Korean Provisional Government. For Kim, independence was never a policy to be negotiated. It was [color=gold][b]holy, indivisible, absolute[/b][/color] — and he bore it like a cross.

Others bent, but [b]Kim Ku never bowed[/b]. When cultural nationalists like [b]Yi Kwang-su[/b] sought to uplift Koreans with literature, he scorned them as [i]weak[/i]. When pragmatists like [b]Lyuh Woon-hyung[/b] urged coalitions, Kim demanded to know: [color=blue][i]coalition with whom?[/i][/color] With Koreans who bled for their country, he would clasp hands. With [b]collaborators[/b], [b]opportunists[/b], or [b]foreign patrons[/b] — [color=red][i]never[/i][/color]. Even when [b]Syngman Rhee[/b] lobbied endlessly abroad, Kim dismissed it as [i]begging before emperors[/i]. To him, there was only one path: [color=gold][b]unity in spirit[/b][/color], [color=gold][b]resistance in body[/b][/color], and a Korea purged of compromise with corruption or outsiders.

Now, in [b]1948[/b], the fragile People’s Republic elevates him as its [b]moral lodestar[/b]. Kim Ku is no politician; he barely tolerates politics at all. He speaks instead of the [color=gold][i]Korean soul[/i][/color], of [i]sacrifice[/i] and [i]destiny[/i], of a nation reborn not through negotiation but through struggle. His admirers see him as a [b]living martyr[/b], proof that Korea still has men who cannot be bought. His detractors whisper that he is an [i]anachronism[/i], a zealot who would rather see the country burn than bend. To Kim Ku, both are correct. He would rather see Korea [color=red][b]die pure[/b][/color] than [color=gray][i]live compromised[/i][/color].

The Republic survives by balance and accommodation. But [b]balance means nothing[/b] to a man who has lived his whole life for [color=gold][i]absolutes[/i][/color]. Kim Ku does not ask for survival. He demands [color=gold][b]salvation[/b][/color]. And in that demand lies [color=gold][b]both his greatness[/b][/color] — [color=red][b]and the nation’s peril.[/b][/color]
