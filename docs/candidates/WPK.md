Pak Heon-yeong was born in 1900 and came of age in a Korea already shackled. Where other nationalists spoke of destiny or martyrdom, Pak saw only structure and class. Arrested and exiled as a student agitator, he turned to Marxism as both explanation and weapon. To him, Korea had not been lost because of foreign bayonets alone, but because its own leaders were weak, venal, and divided. Only socialism, disciplined and uncompromising, could preserve the nation from another century of servitude.

After decades of underground struggle, arrests, and survival against impossible odds, Pak emerged in 1945 as the most formidable of Korea’s communists. His networks were real, his following authentic. But his position was never secure. He lived under the shadow of the Cominform, whose demands were as suffocating as they were contradictory. Too radical, and he alienated moderates; too cautious, and Moscow would brand him a deviationist. His fate lay not only in Seoul, but in distant offices in Moscow.

Worse still were the Soviet Koreans. Men like Ho Ka-i, the Yeonan faction, and Kim Il-sung’s guerrillas returned with Moscow’s blessing, ready to claim authority in a land they had abandoned. Pak loathed them. He knew they were pawns, designed to weaken him, to divide the Workers’ Party until it was dependent on Moscow’s mediation. His suspicion was no paranoia: the Soviets wanted pliable puppets, not independent communists. And every meeting, every committee, every slogan was another battlefield in which he had to prove his loyalty while watching his authority bled away.

Pak Heon-yeong believes history is on his side, that socialism’s victory is inevitable. The tragedy is that he may be right — and yet he may not live to see it, undone not by his enemies, but by the allies Moscow sent to bury him.
