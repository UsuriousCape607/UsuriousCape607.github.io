[b]Park Heon-yeong[/b] was born in [b]1900[/b] and came of age in a Korea already shackled. Where other nationalists spoke of [i]destiny[/i] or [i]martyrdom[/i], Park saw only [color=red][b]structure[/b][/color] and [color=red][b]class[/b][/color]. Arrested and exiled as a student agitator, he turned to [b]Marxism[/b] as both [i]explanation[/i] and [i]weapon[/i]. To him, Korea had not been lost because of foreign bayonets alone, but because its own leaders were [color=gray][i]weak[/i][/color], [color=gray][i]venal[/i][/color], and [color=gray][i]divided[/i][/color]. Only [color=red][b]socialism[/b][/color], disciplined and uncompromising, could preserve the nation from another century of servitude.

After decades of [b]underground struggle[/b], [b]arrests[/b], and survival against impossible odds, Park emerged in [b]1945[/b] as the most formidable of Korea’s communists. His networks were real, his following authentic. Yet his position was never secure. He lived under the shadow of the [b]Cominform[/b], whose dictates were as suffocating as they were contradictory. Too radical, and he alienated moderates. Too cautious, and Moscow would brand him a [color=gray][i]deviationist[/i][/color]. His fate lay not only in Seoul, but in [color=blue][i]distant offices he did not control[/i][/color].

Worse still were the [b]Soviet Koreans[/b]. Men like [b]Ho Ka-i[/b], the [b]Yeonan faction[/b], and [b]Kim Il-sung’s guerrillas[/b] returned with Moscow’s blessing, ready to claim authority in a land they had abandoned. Park loathed them. To him they were [i]parasites[/i], designed to weaken him, to divide the Workers’ Party until it was dependent on Moscow’s arbitration. His suspicion was no paranoia: the Soviets wanted [color=red][b]pliable puppets[/b][/color], not independent communists. Every meeting, every committee, every slogan became a battlefield where he had to prove his loyalty while watching his authority [color=gray][i]bleed away[/i][/color].

[b]Park Heon-yeong[/b] believes [color=red][i]history is on his side[/i][/color], that [b]socialism’s victory[/b] is inevitable. But his tragedy lies in the compromise he cannot escape: he must bargain with [b]Moscow[/b] to hold his position, even as he despises the very tools they send to undermine him. He may be right about history — yet he may not live to see it, undone not by his enemies, but by the [color=red][b]allies Moscow sent to bury him[/b][/color].
