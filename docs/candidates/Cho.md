[b]Cho Man-sik[/b] was born in [b]1882[/b] in [b]Pyongyang[/b], raised on the twin pillars of [i]Korean tradition[/i] and [i]Presbyterian faith[/i]. He came to embody the virtues of [color=gold][b]duty[/b][/color], [color=gold][b]sobriety[/b][/color], and [color=gold][b]integrity[/b][/color], earning the title “[i]the Gandhi of Korea[/i].” For Cho, independence was not only a political program but a [color=gold][b]moral mission[/b][/color]: the salvation of a people through [i]righteousness[/i] and [i]national solidarity[/i]. He lived modestly, taught, organized, and led boycotts, inspiring thousands by example.

Yet Cho was no simple dreamer. Unlike many Christian nationalists of his time, he refused to dismiss the appeal of [b]socialism[/b]. To him, the true dividing line was not [i]left versus right[/i], but [color=red][b]Korean versus foreign[/b][/color]. He was willing to work with [b]Communists[/b] so long as they were [b]Korean patriots[/b], not [i]exiles flown in from Moscow[/i] or men parroting orders from abroad. His openness to coalition made him seem [color=blue][i]pragmatic[/i][/color] to some, [color=gray][i]dangerously naïve[/i][/color] to others. Where [b]Rhee[/b] saw betrayal, and [b]Pak[/b] saw class struggle, Cho clung to a stubborn belief that Koreans could govern themselves together, if only they put [color=gold][b]Korea first[/b][/color].

That belief left him [color=gray][i]isolated[/i][/color]. Nationalists saw him as [i]too soft[/i], Communists saw him as [i]too bourgeois[/i], and foreign powers saw little use for a man who would not bend. Still, Cho endured as a [b]moral beacon[/b], admired but seldom heeded. His refusal to compromise principle for expedience ensured his [color=gold][b]purity[/b][/color] — and his [color=gray][i]irrelevance[/i][/color]. In a Korea ruled by [b]prophets[/b], [b]martyrs[/b], and [b]revolutionaries[/b], [b]Cho Man-sik[/b] remained the conscience: respected, but sidelined, always a [i]guide[/i], never a [i]commander[/i].
